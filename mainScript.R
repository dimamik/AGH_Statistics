# Sex

#Let's see is gender connected with charges

# Regression model

# Build linear model using all possible variables and analyse the result
model_all <- lm(charges ~ age + sex + bmi + children + smoker,data)
summary(model_all)

# Analyse the results for group of data to figure out which needs to be removed
# And which relationships are the strongest 

# Standard Error -> measures the average amount 
# that the coefficient estimates vary from the actual average value of our response variable
# Expectations -> lower number relative to estimation coefficients
# Reality -> For age and bmi this values are low enough 

# T Value -> is a measure of how many standard deviations our coefficient estimate is far away from 0.
# Expectations -> if it is far away from 0, we can reject null-hypothesis (declare that relationship)
# exists
# Reality -> For age,bmi and smokers it seems that some kind of relationship exists, but
# The strongest one for a first look is with smokers (Need to mention that we are talking about
# Relationship with Charges)

# Pr(> |t|) -> relates to the probability of observing any value equal or larger than t.
# In other words, indicates, the possibility of value/relation been observed by chance
# Expectations -> less than 0.05
# Reality -> for all except gender is less than 0.05, which satisfies us

# Residual standard error -> measure of quality of linear regression fit
# In other words it is the average amount that the response (age/bmi etc.) 
# will deviate from the true regression line.
# Expectations -> Lower, comparing with estimate, better.
# Also expecting it to be normal
# Reality -> Only for smokers we can see low difference, or about 25% error on guessing

# Multiple R-squared -> a measure of how well the model is fitting the actual data.
# Expectations -> Close to 1
# Reality -> 74% , not bad, but can be better

# Adjusted R-squared -> it adjusts Multiple R-squared for the number of variables considered.
# Expectations -> Close to 1
# Reality -> 0.7488 = 74%

# F-statistics -> indicator of whether there is a relationship 
# between our predictor and the response variables.
# Expectations -> The further from 1 the better (comparing with data size and predictors)
# Reality -> 798

# So to start with, I'd remove not really suitable sex and children, and check weather Residual standard error is 
# Following normal distribution

# As we can see, Residual standard error is not following normal distribution, 
# and R-squared can still be better

# Now I suggest looking at Smoking closely, because it affects charges the most,
# But as we saw in previous analysis, smokers can be devided into two categories
# Those with low and high BMI
# I suggest us doing that, by adding new variable -> SmokerWithHighBMI

data$SmokerWithHighBMI <- ifelse(data$bmi>30 & data$smoker=="yes","yes","no")

summary(model)

# Analysing as in previous model, we can come to 
# Adjusted R-squared is 85,8%, which is higher than in previous model
# which gives us the possibility to say that data is fitting the model
# Errors are lower, t-values are greater, Pr( >|t|) is slightly bigger 
# on average, which, makes our results more random, but for all
# except BMI it's still less than 0.05, which is normal

# Now lets build Residual standard error and check if is 
# Following normal distribution

res <- resid(model)
qqnorm(res)

# let's also check for plots of our model parameters
plot(model,2)

# Residuals vs Fitted ->  shows if residuals have non-linear patterns. 
# In our case we have a bit clustered left side which means that there are 
# Some outliers not covered by model

# Normal Q-Q -> Shows if residuals are normally distributed
# As we can see there is a part when data stops following the normal distribution
# Which means that our model doesn't cover all the outliers, and 
# Error while defining them can be significant !!! Which means that we need to work
# More on model

# Scale-Location ->  the assumption of equal variance
# Data is not spread randomly on the line, which is not quite good

# Residuals vs Leverage ->   This plot helps us to find influential cases (i.e., subjects) if any. 
# Watch if Cook's distance is high

# Let's search more


# let's consider more age impact

# Now build the model
model<- lm (log(charges) ~ age  + ade^2 + smoker+ bmi + SmokerWithHighBMI + children,data)

# As we can see, data on graphics is better distributed, but we still have problems
